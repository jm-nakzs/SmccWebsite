                        <p>Healthcare services are essential in schools to ensure the safety and health of students. This student support service provides first aid services to students. These health services are available to deal with any kind of medical emergency that may occur in school. Doctors and nurses are appointed to provide medical support to students.</p>

                        <p>Career guidance centers are necessary for schools to provide students with an opportunity to clearly define their career prospects. Career counselors who are trained experts would help students to understand their strengths and weaknesses and make a career path based on the analysis. They also help students to strategize their learning that matches their career interests. They give students details about how they can build a career based on their interests. The career counselor would also give suggestions to students with the help of which students can choose their careers..</p>

                    <h4>Recreation Centers</h4>
                    <p>Recreation centers are a space for like-minded students to gather and do activities that interest them. These activities can be sports, discussion, debates, craft classes, fitness programs, etc. These recreation centers are a great opportunity for the students to improve their skill sets. As like-minded students gather in a single space, they get an opportunity to interact and collaborate with students who have similar interests. This fosters a sense of community among the students. These centers are a great way to flourish a student's interest outside the school curriculum.</p>
